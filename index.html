                <p>My darling Emma,</p>
                <p>Even though our journey together has just begun, my heart is already overflowing with a love for you that I never knew was possible. Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream, and I find myself smiling just thinking about you.</p>
                <p>I know it's early, but I can already picture our future together. I can't wait to marry you, to build a home filled with laughter and joy, and to have a family with you. You are everything I've ever wanted.</p>
                <p>Forever and always,</p>

                <p>Can you believe it's already been a week? Every Wednesday feels like a special milestone with you knowing it's our Anniversary, a reminder of the beautiful journey we've started. Each day, I find myself falling for you more and more.</p>
                <p>This past week has been filled with moments I'll cherish forever, all because you were in them. You bring so much light and happiness into my life, and I can't imagine a single day without you.</p>
                <p>Here's to another week of love, laughter, and us. I love you more than words can say.</p>
                <p>Forever yours,</p>
