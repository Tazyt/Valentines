                <p>My darling Emma,</p>
                <p>Even though our journey together has just begun, my heart is already overflowing with a love for you that I never knew was possible. Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream, and I find myself smiling just thinking about you.</p>
                <p>I know it's early, but I can already picture our future together. I can't wait to marry you, to build a home filled with laughter and joy, and to have a family with you. You are everything I've ever wanted.</p>
                <p>Forever and always,</p>
                <p>Dayshan ❤️</p>
