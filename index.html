                    <p>My darling Amber,</p>
                    <p>Even though our journey together has just begun, my heart is already overflowing with a love for you that I never knew was possible. Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream, and I find myself smiling just thinking about you. You're as beautiful and precious to me as the roses you love so much.</p>
                    <p>I know it's early, but I can already picture our future together. I can't wait to marry you, to build a home filled with laughter and joy, and to have a family with you. I'll fill our garden with roses, just like how you've filled my heart with love. You are everything I've ever wanted.</p>
                    <p>Forever and always, like roses that bloom eternal,</p>
